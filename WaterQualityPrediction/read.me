AICTE Virtual Internship – June 2025

Project Overview
Ensuring access to safe and clean water is a major global challenge. This project addresses the issue by leveraging machine learning to predict multiple water quality indicators simultaneously. The model was developed as part of a one-month virtual internship under AICTE, in collaboration with Edunet Foundation and sponsored by Shell.

Objectives

To develop a predictive system for evaluating key water quality parameters

To use multi-target regression techniques for environmental data analysis

To support early pollution detection and informed water management

Key Contributions

Acquired and cleaned real-world datasets related to water quality

Implemented a MultiOutputRegressor using RandomForestRegressor for handling multiple outputs

Evaluated the model using R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Built an end-to-end ML pipeline including preprocessing, modeling, and visualization

Technologies and Tools Used

Python 3.12 – Core programming

Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing and manipulation

Scikit-learn – Machine learning implementation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development environment

Predicted Parameters
The model predicts several critical water quality indicators:

NH4, BOD5 (BSK5), Colloids

Oxygen (O₂), Nitrate (NO₃), Nitrite (NO₂)

Sulfate (SO₄), Phosphate (PO₄), Chloride (Cl⁻)

Model Evaluation

The Random Forest-based model demonstrated strong performance across most parameters

Metrics: R² Score, MSE

Results indicate the model's reliability for environmental monitoring tasks
